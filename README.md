<p><font size=5 color="sky blue">She died. I survived.
Because I survived, I died everyday.
I was bound by my stars to live a lonely life. Without her, I felt so alone. Though the fact is that it’s just she who is gone and everything else is the same. But this ‘everything else’ is nothing to me ...<br>
—Excerpt from the novel<br>
After the reunion, Ravin comes back to Bhubaneswar, where he works as an engineer for Infosys, and registers at Shaadi.com. After a few days of registering on the site, Ravin finds a girl named Khushi, a resident of Delhi, and an employee of CSC, Noida. Ravin and Khushi start talking to each other over phone and soon become good friends. They become curious about each other's interest and find there are many similarities between them. After a few months of conversation over phone, they realize that they have started falling in love with each other, although they have never met face-to-face. Very soon, Ravin is asked to travel to the United States for an office assignment. He is required to go to Delhi, where Khushi lives, to board the international flight. Ravin decides to go to Delhi one day earlier to meet Khushi for the first time, and spend time with her.<br>
<br>

In Delhi, Ravin meets Khushi and her family including her mother and sisters and then starts his journey to the US. Even during his stay in the US, Ravin is constantly in touch with Khushi. After his return to India, Ravin meets Khushi once again. After sometime, Khushi's family visits Bhubaneswar and meet Ravin's parents. There, they decide the date of Ravin and Khushi's engagement. Both the families start preparing for the event.<br>
<br>


Just before the engagement, Khushi meets with a road accident and is hospitalized in a critical condition. Despite all medical attempts and prayers of Ravin, Khushi dies after a few days. The novel ends with Ravin's narration of his current mental condition. To Ravin, his life has become meaningless after Khushi's death and he has lost interest in almost everything. He feels "She died. I survived. Because I survived, I die everyday."</font></p>
